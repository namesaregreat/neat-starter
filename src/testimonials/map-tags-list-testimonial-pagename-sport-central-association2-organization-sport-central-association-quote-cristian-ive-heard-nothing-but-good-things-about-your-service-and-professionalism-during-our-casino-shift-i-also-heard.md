quote: Cristian, I've heard nothing but good things about your service and
  professionalism during our Casino shift. I also heard similar positive reviews
  about Katy who, I assume, is your assistant/helper. As you know, our
  relationship and early contract discussions were a bit rocky, but I am more
  than willing to give credit where it is due and clearly you have earned that
  from the Sport Central Casino workers/volunteers. Thank you for helping our
  team and making the two days pleasurable and efficient.
