                <p>In Alberta, a Casino Advisor typically plays a role in providing guidance and support related to casino operations and compliance with gaming regulations. Specific responsibilities may vary, but some common duties of a Casino Advisor in Alberta could include:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Regulatory Compliance:</b> Ensuring that the casino adheres to all relevant gaming laws and regulations set by the Alberta Gaming, Liquor, and Cannabis (AGLC) Commission.

                <p>
                    <b>Training and Education:</b> Providing training to casino staff on regulatory compliance, responsible gaming practices, and other relevant topics. This helps ensure that employees are well-informed and capable of upholding the required standards.
                </p>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>
                    <b>Auditing and Monitoring:</b> Conducting regular audits and assessments to monitor the casino's operations and identify any areas of non-compliance. This may involve reviewing financial records, security measures, and other aspects of the casino's activities.
                </p>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>
                    <b>Problem Resolution:</b> Assisting in resolving any issues or disputes that may arise within the casino environment, particularly those related to gaming activities. This could involve collaboration with regulatory authorities and other stakeholders.

                <hr class="divider">
                <p>
                    <b>Community Engagement:</b> Building positive relationships between the casino and the community by promoting responsible gaming practices and participating in community outreach initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to note that the specific duties of a Casino Advisor may vary based on the organization, the size of the casino, and the dynamic regulatory environment. Additionally, the role may involve collaboration with regulatory bodies, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to ensure the overall integrity of gaming activities in Alberta.

            </dt>
            <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
                <p>Most groups will use a schedule divided in a day shift and a night shift for the cash cage, and a late night shift for the count room. Based on the location of your casino event, you will need 4-6 volunteers/day for each shift, with shift duration of 8-10 hours (4.5 hours for the count room). If you think the shifts are too long and you have a large number of volunteers, you could divide the day in a morning shift, afternoon/evening shift and night shift for the cash cage, with shift duration of approximately 6 hours. Please contact us to discuss your options.</p>

            <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
                <p>Once you get the location and dates of your casino event, contact us for a schedule template; with this, you can create an online signup sheet using one of the following websites:</p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    You will get a link to your signup sheet that you can share with your pool of volunteers. Please advise you volunteers that they can sign up for more than one shift, as long as they remain in the same position for the duration of the casino event.

            </dt>
            <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
                <p>All groups that had a casino event in the same region and quarter receive an equal share of the proceeds. The amount of proceeds varies among regions and quarters. AGLC provides casino proceeds by electronic funds transfer. Groups receive proceeds about six to eight weeks after the end of the quarter that the group had its event. For example, a group that had an event in February will receive money in its casino bank account by mid to late May.</p>

                <p>
                    At the completion of the event, you will have to fill out the Request for Casino Licence:
                </p>

                <p>
                    After AGLC processes your request (6-8 weeks after your submission), you will receive a slotting letter with the next calendar quarter of your event. Once you receive the slotting letter, is your responsibility to contact the casino facility to secure a spot in that quarter. You will get the exact dates of your event 5 months before the beginning of your assigned calendar quarter.

                    AGLC sends information and instructions to the casino chairperson five months before the quarter that the group has its event. For example, AGLC sends the information in August for the event in January - March the following year.
